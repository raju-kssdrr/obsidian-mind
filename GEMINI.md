# Obsidian Mind

This vault is built for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) with a full operating manual in `CLAUDE.md`.

**Read `CLAUDE.md` for all vault conventions** — structure, note types, linking rules, frontmatter schemas, indexes, and workflows. Most of the content is agent-agnostic.

## Hooks

The hook scripts in `.claude/scripts/` are agent-agnostic Python and shell — no Claude SDK dependencies. Hook configs are provided for three agents:

| Agent | Config | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Claude Code | `.claude/settings.json` | Full support |
| Codex CLI | `.codex/hooks.json` | Shared hook scripts |
| Gemini CLI | `.gemini/settings.json` | Shared hook scripts |

| Script | Purpose | Claude event | Codex event | Gemini event |
|--------|---------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| `session-start.sh` | Inject vault context at startup | SessionStart | SessionStart | SessionStart |
| `classify-message.py` | Classify messages, inject routing hints | UserPromptSubmit | UserPromptSubmit | BeforeAgent |
| `validate-write.py` | Validate frontmatter and wikilinks | PostToolUse | PostToolUse | AfterTool |
| `pre-compact.sh` | Back up transcript before compaction | PreCompact | — | PreCompress |

## Commands

18 slash commands in `.claude/commands/` — agent-agnostic markdown with YAML frontmatter. Invoke as `/om-standup`, `/om-dump`, etc. in any agent that supports custom commands or skills.

## Memory

The vault's memory lives in `brain/` — `Memories.md`, `Patterns.md`, `Key Decisions.md`, `Gotchas.md`. These are plain markdown files that any agent can read and write. When you learn something worth remembering, write it to the relevant `brain/` topic note with a wikilink to context.

The `~/.claude/` auto-loaded memory index is Claude Code-specific — skip that section in `CLAUDE.md`. The vault-side `brain/` notes are the source of truth.

## Subagents

9 subagents in `.claude/agents/` handle isolated tasks (brag spotting, vault auditing, cross-linking, etc.). The prompt content is agent-agnostic markdown. Codex CLI (`.codex/agents/`) and Gemini CLI (`.gemini/agents/`) support the same pattern — copy the files and adapt the YAML frontmatter fields to your agent's schema.

## What's Claude Code-specific

Only the `~/.claude/` auto-memory loader is truly Claude Code-specific. Everything else — hooks, commands, subagent prompts, vault memory — is portable.

## Setup

**Codex CLI**: Reads `AGENTS.md` natively. For direct access to `CLAUDE.md`, add to `~/.codex/config.toml`:
```toml
project_doc_fallback_filenames = ["CLAUDE.md"]
```

**Gemini CLI**: Reads `GEMINI.md` natively. For direct access to `CLAUDE.md`, add to `~/.gemini/settings.json`:
```json
{ "context": { "fileName": ["GEMINI.md", "CLAUDE.md"] } }
```

**Other agents** (Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot): Read `AGENTS.md` for vault conventions. Hook support varies by agent.

For more information, see the [README](README.md).
